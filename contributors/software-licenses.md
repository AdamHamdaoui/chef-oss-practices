# Software Licenses for Contributors

**NOTE: This is still in draft form and is being reviewed by Chef Legal/Leadership**

Under Chef's [license terms](https://www.chef.io/end-user-license-agreement/), Chef's binaries are free for individual use, however they are not free for use (except under circumstances outlined in the license) by organizations or corporations.  Normally these entities must pay for a license to use binaries of Chef's software that are compiled and created by Chef.

However, Chef does offer free Contributor Licenses to corporations/organizations in exchange for significant contribution. This contribution can include employees (on company time) contributing to Chef Open Source projects and more.  These corporations/organizations can then apply for a Contributor License from Chef Software. Granting the license is at the sole discretion of Chef Software.

Chef is currently putting together guidance on what a "significant" contribution means and a detailed application process. These will be announced soon, so please stay tuned!
