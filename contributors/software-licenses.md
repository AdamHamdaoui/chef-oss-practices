# Software Licenses for Contributors

**NOTE: This is still in draft form and is being reviewed by Chef Legal/Leadership**

Under Chef's license terms [LINK TO EXACT TERMS TO BE ADDED], Chef's binaries are free for individual use, however they are not free for use (except under circumstances outlined in the license) by organizations or corporations.  Normally these entities must pay for a license to use binaries of Chef's software that are compiled and created by Chef.

However, Chef does offer free Contributor Licenses to corporations/organizations in exchange for significant contribution. This contribution can include employees (on company time) contributing to Chef Open Source projects and more.  These corporations/organizations can then apply for a Contributor License from Chef Software. Granting the license is at the sole discretion of Chef Software.

Laying out exact terms for contribution is difficult as we welcome and embrace the many ways someone can contribute to Chef and the Chef Community. Here are some examples of what we would consider significant contribution:

- Contributing (and maintaining) one or more well used community cookbooks
- Contributing (and maintaining) one of more Habitat Core Plans
- Contributing a **significant** feature to any Chef Open Source Project
- Contributing a **significant** bug fix to any Chef Open Source Project
- Contributing documentation and tutorials for Chef products
- Contributing work to a fork of a Chef project that is integrated into the upstream Chef product

If you feel you have made a significant contribution that is not in this list, please feel free to apply for a license anyway - we would love to hear from you!
