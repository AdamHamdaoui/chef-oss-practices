# Triaging and Prioritizing Issues

There is a difference between triaging and prioritizing issues that come into GitHub. This outline documents the differences between the two.

## Triage

Each project team holds public issue and pull request triage, with a schedule listed in their team documentation.

For more information on the triage process, please check out [the Triage document in this repo](./communication/triage.md).
