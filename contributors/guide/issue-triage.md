# Triaging and Prioritizing Issues

There is a difference between triaging and priortizing issues that come into GitHub. This outline documents the differences between the two.

## Triage

Open Source triages are held in public.

For more information, please check out [the Triage document in this repo](./communication/triage.md).

## Prioritization

When issues are triaged and added to the backlog, they must then be prioritized. Factors in an issue's assigned priority include current workload, business strategy, customer impact, and more.

Because customer impact and business strategy may be confidential, prioritizing issues on Chef projects must be done in private by both the Product manager and Engineering manager associated with the project.
