# Triaging and Prioritizing Issues

There is a difference between triaging and priortizing issues that come into GitHub. This outline documents the differences between the two.

## Triage

Open Source triages are held in public [#TO DO - add details around how to do this].

Triage should include:
* Going through issues that have been filed on the project since the last triage
* Deciding whether to accept or close and issue (i.e. duplicate issues should be closed)
* [Labeling](../../github_labels.md) issues as appropriate 
* Adding accepted issues to the backlog

How often triages are held is up to the project team, but we suggest once a week. Both developers and product managers should be present for the triage.

## Prioritization

When issues are triaged and added to the backlog, they must then be prioritized. Factors in an issue's assigned priority include current workload, business strategy, customer impact, and more.

Because customer impact and business strategy may be confidential, prioritizing issues on Chef projects must be done in private by both the Product manager and Engineering manager associated with the project.
