# Maintainership of Projects

## Definition
* Projects have **maintainers**, not authors
* The maintainers are responsible for merging pull requests, triaging issues, and more.

## Rules and Responsibilities
* At least two maintainers must be current Chef employees
* Roadmaps are planned by Product Management, Engineering Leadership, and maintainers (including external maintainers - who have input, but not veto power)
* Maintainers are responsible for **communicating** overall project planning and roadmap of their project.
* Maintainer reviews are required on all code and maintainers are the only ones that can merge code into a project. If you need to merge code, then you are a maintainer.
* All maintainer team discussion outside of security issues should be done in a public forum.
* The maintainer team is added as a codeowner on their repository so that they are automatically setup via Github for code reviews
* All contributions must include Developer Certificate of Origin signoff
* A tool is setup to ping maintainers for reviews / triage.
