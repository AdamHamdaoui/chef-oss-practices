# Chef Software Projects

Software projects at Chef  are made up many libraries and sub-projects managed by Chef. There are currently over 500 such software repostories which together make up our core projects:

- [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef/) - A systems integration framework, built to bring the benefits of configuration management to your entire infrastructure.
- [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) - A testing framework for infrastructure with a human- and machine-readable language for specifying compliance, security and policy requirements.
- [Habitat](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/) - Software that creates platform-independent build artifacts and provides built-in deployment and management capabilities.
- [Automate](https://github.com/chef/automate/) - Automate gives users actionable data about their applications and infrastructure automation as well as the tools to take action based on that data.
