# Language Specific Guilds

## Summary

In order to foster a culture of learning and shared empathy it is recommended
that programming language specific guilds be created. These guilds serve as a
place where like minded people can gather and discuss the guild's language and
it's implementation. The purpose of this document is to lay out what the goals
of these guilds should be and give an example of how these guilds could be
implemented.

## Goals of the Guilds

These are the some of the goals of a language specific guild:
  - Answer questions about the guild's language and implementation internally
  - Assist new users/developers in learning the language and increasing skills
  - Help define recommended standards/best practices

These guilds should consist of multiple people so decisions can be made
democratically. The guilds should also focus on creating recommended practices
and not enforcement of those practices. Enforcement and adoption should occur
with the users and their managers.

## Recommended Implementation

In order to build a successful language specific guild it is recommended that
you:
  - Have a channel for communication (ex: #rust-guild in Slack)
  - Have periodic meetings where topics can be discussed
  - Catalog information and results of conversations
