# Community Members in Crisis

In the past we have had community members express suicidal thoughts or ideas. When these situations arise,  it is critical that we respond in a way that is empathetic to that community member, point them to the professional resources that they need, and protects the rest of the community.

We are not mental health professionals, but provide an important role in encouraging a community member to seek the help they need. This guide is meant to guide our responses when a community member expresses thoughts or ideas involving suicide or other self harm.

This response guide is heavily based on the [Support for Suicidal Individuals on Social and Digital Media](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/lifeline_socialmedia_toolkit.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3r_m7IUOFcMBLmqmd4thToc7bWkoF3UvR7-9QggooY3susl6qrX6g-nms) guide from the [Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/). Every community advocate and moderator must read this guide. We also encourage every member of the Chef community to also familiarize themselves with this guide.

## IMMINENT RISK - The Exception to All Rules

See the "The Exception to all rules: Imminent Risk" section of [Support for Suicidal Individuals on Social and Digital Media](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/lifeline_socialmedia_toolkit.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3r_m7IUOFcMBLmqmd4thToc7bWkoF3UvR7-9QggooY3susl6qrX6g-nms) guide from the [Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/). 

In this situation, it is essential to immediately reach out to a Chef employee (DM or Twitter might be best in this situation), who will then immediately notify Jenny Armstrong-Owen (her phone number is in the internal Company directory). If she is not available, the Chef employee must notify another employee at manager level or above to escalate the situation.

If you are not immediately able to reach Jenny Armstrong-Owen or a Chef employee at manager level or above, call your local emergency services line (i.e 911 in the U.S., 112 in Europe or Australia, or whatever number is appropriate for your local area). Emergency dispatch will be able to assist with reaching resources in the community member's local area.

## Checklist

If a community member expresses thoughts or ideas that indicate they are at risk for suicide - but not at imminent risk - (see the "How to Identify Someone at Risk for Suicide Online" section of [Support for Suicidal Individuals on Social and Digital Media](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/lifeline_socialmedia_toolkit.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3r_m7IUOFcMBLmqmd4thToc7bWkoF3UvR7-9QggooY3susl6qrX6g-nms) guide from the [Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/), follow this checklist.
