# Communication

The Chef Community is committed to keeping our space a fun, safe, and productive place to be, so please review the Community [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md) before getting started. In general:

- *Be Nice.* We get more done when people are helpful and respectful of one another. Plus, it feels better.
- *Listen.* Try to understand someone's position before you negate a suggestion or idea. Ask clarifying questions if something doesn't make sense to you.
- *Be Patient.* We have no team dedicated solely to Community support, so responses will be semi-synchronous, or, more likely, asynchronous. Know that the Community appreciates all your contributions, and we're working to be as responsive as possible.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

[Process TBD]

## Communication Channels

We have four communication channels, each with its own specific purpose.

###GitHub 

GitHub is the Chef Community's preferred durable medium for open and transparent development of software. All development conversation must be captured in GitHub. Any decisions made in internal Chef Slack channels, Zoom sessions, or any other communication medium must be summarized in GitHub [the exact format for adding this info to GitHub is TBD].

###Community Slack

 Sometimes it will make sense to have a brief, non-durable conversation with an external Project Member about development on a project. Have these exchanges in Community Slack (either in a dev channel or via DM). Any development decisions, etc. arising from the Slack interaction must be documented in GitHub. Conversations in Community Slack about a project should be limited to development on that project. The general community Slack channel is the proper place for non-technical discussion and questions.

###Mailing Lists

The Chef Community mailing lists are hosted via [Discourse](https://discourse.chef.io/). This is the best place to catch up on general and security-related announcements.

###Office Hours

Individual projects host office hours on a periodic basis. This is a great way to get some face time with other Project Members. Each project records and archives sessions to a public location; see individual project documentation for more details.

**Note:** Zoom is a good medium for office hours. Google Hangouts via YouTube is another great option for these calls for a number of reasons. It will allow all members of a team appropriate admin rights to schedule/start/stop the call, it has both a public viewing link and private invite link, and the calls can automatically be recorded and uploaded to a YouTube channel on completion.
