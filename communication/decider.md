# Role of Decider

Chef's previous "decider" for all Chef Open Source projects was Adam Jacob.This worked extremely well for a time. With Chef's Open Source footprint being so vast now (especially with the open sourcing of Automate), having one person in charge of decisions for all projects no longer is sustainable.

Decisions about the direction of Chef Open Source projects (including but not limited to Chef, InSpec, Habitat, and Automate) are now at the discretion of the maintainers of that project and the product manager(s) assigned to that project. We welcome input from all and encourage community members to express opinions on the directions of projects through GitHub or the Chef Discourse forums. We will gladly consider any input and feedback that is offered, but reserve the right to decide whether and how to act on that feedback.
