# Distributions

Along with the [offical Chef distributions](https://downloads.chef.io/) of our Open Source projects, members of our community have also created alternative distributions of Chef's Open Source products. These are listed below.

## cc-build

This includes community distributions of Chef's software (including Chef Infra, InSpec, Habitat, and Automate).
