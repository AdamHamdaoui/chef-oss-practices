There are two offical forms of communication for Chef maintained Open Source projects, each of which has a specific purpose.

# GitHub

All development conversation must be captured in GitHub. Any decisions made in the internal Chef Slack, Zoom, or any other communication medium must be summarized in GitHub (the exact format for adding this info to GitHub is TBD). The duty of summarizing conversations in GitHub must be rotated - it should not fall on only one or two people.

# Community Slack

Occasionally it will be necessary to have a temporary, ephemeral conversation with an external community member about development on the project. These conversations should happen in the Community Slack (either in a channel or via DM). Any development decisions, etc. must be documented in GitHub. Conversations in Community Slack about a project should be limited to development on that project.
