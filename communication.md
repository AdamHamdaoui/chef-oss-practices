There are two forms of communication, each of which has a specific purpose.

# GitHub

All development conversation must be captured in GitHub. Any decisions made in the internal Chef Slack or Zoom or any other communication medium must be summarized in GitHub (the exact format for adding this info to GitHub is TBD).

# Community Slack

Occasionally it will be necessary to have a temporary, ephemeral conversation with an external community member about development on the project. These conversations should happen in the Community Slack (either in a channel or via DM). Any development decisions, etc. must be documented in GitHub. Conversations in Community Slack about a project should be limited to development on that project.
