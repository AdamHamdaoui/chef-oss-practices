# Project membership

## New contributors

[New contributors] should be welcomed to the community by existing project members, helped with PR workflow, and directed to relevant documentation and communication channels.

## Established project members

Established project members are expected to demonstrate their adherence to the principles in this document, familiarity with project organization, roles, policies, procedures, conventions, etc., and technical and/or writing ability. Role-specific expectations, responsibilities, and requirements are enumerated below.

**Note:** This document is in progress, it outlines the various responsibilities of project roles in the Chef Software Inc. OSS Communities.  Chef's software projects are subdivided into projects and subprojects under teams. Responsibilities/Privileges for most roles are scoped to a project or subproject.

| Project Role | Responsibilities | Requirements | Defined by |
| -----| ---------------- | ------------ | -------|
| member | active contributor in the community | sponsored by 2 reviewers or approvers.  multiple contributions to the project. | Project GitHub org member. |
| reviewer | review contributions from other members | history of review and authorship in a subproject | [CODEOWNERS] file reviewer entry. |
| approver | final approval and acceptance of contributions | highly experienced and active reviewer + contributor to a subproject | [CODEOWNERS] file approver entry|
| subproject owner | set direction and priorities for a subproject | demonstrated responsibility and excellent technical judgement for the subproject | [teams.yaml] subproject [CODEOWNERS] file *owners* entry |


## Member

Project Members are continuously active contributors in the community.  They can have issues and PRs assigned to them, participate in project teams through GitHub teams, and pre-submit tests are automatically run for their PRs. Members are expected to remain active contributors to the community. On approval of membership a user's membership will last until the end of the calendar year from their approval. If a member remains active their membership will be automatically extended. In the case that a member becomes inactive their membership will be revoked at the end of the calendar year.

**Defined by:** Member of the Chef Software Inc. Project Organization on GitHub

### Chef Software Ecosystem

There are many interrelated [Chef Software GitHub organizations], such as [habitat](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat), [chef](https://github.com/chef), and [inspec](https://github.com/chef/inspec). Membership to 1 organization doesn't inherently grant membership to another, however the perks and membership process are uniform no matter what organization or Chef Software Inc. project you contribute to.

### Responsibilities and privileges

- Responsive to issues and PRs assigned to them
- Responsive to mentions of teams they are members of
- Active owner of code they have contributed (unless ownership is explicitly transferred)
  - Code is well tested
  - Tests consistently pass
  - Addresses bugs or issues discovered after code is accepted
- Members can do `/lgtm` on open PRs.
- They can be assigned to issues and PRs, and people can ask members for reviews with a `/cc @username`.
- Tests can be run against their PRs automatically (In projects leveraging Chef's expeditor framework). No `/ok-to-test` needed.
- Members can do `/ok-to-test` for PRs that have a `T-needs-ok-to-test` label, and use commands like `/close` to close PRs as well.
- Invite to the yearly Community Summit
- Members Only Swag pack

**Note:** Members who frequently contribute code are expected to proactively perform code reviews and work towards becoming a primary *reviewer* for the subproject that they are active in. If a member drops below a reasonable threshold of activity (definable, project to project) for 5 months they will be sent a warning notifying them that they have 1 month to re-assert their activity or their membership will be revoked. Former members, or Alumni, are always welcome to seek a membership refresh at any time.

## Reviewer

Reviewers are able to review code for quality and correctness on some part of a subproject. They are knowledgeable about both the codebase and software engineering principles.

**Defined by:** *reviewers* entry in an CODEOWNERS file in a repo owned by the
specific Chef Software Inc. Project.

Reviewer status is scoped to a part of the codebase.

**Note:** Acceptance of code contributions requires at least one approver in
addition to the assigned reviewers.

### Requirements

The following apply to the part of codebase for which one would be a reviewer in
an [CODEOWNERS] file (for repos using the bot).

- Member for at least 3 months
- Primary reviewer for at least 5 PRs to the codebase
- Reviewed or merged some large (relative to the project) number of substantial PRs to the codebase. In the case of a high activity project like Chef, or Habitat we suggest that number be around 20 PRs.
- Knowledgeable about the codebase
- Sponsored by a subproject approver
  - With no objections from other approvers
  - Done through PR to update the OWNERS file
- May either self-nominate, be nominated by an approver in this subproject, or be nominated by a robot

### Responsibilities and privileges

The following apply to the part of codebase for which one would be a reviewer in a [CODEOWNERS] file (for repos using the bot).

- Tests are automatically run for PullRequests from members of the specified GitHub organization (where the project is leveraging Chef's Expeditor framework)
- Code reviewer status may be a precondition to accepting large code contributions
- Responsible for project quality control via [code reviews]
  - Focus on code quality and correctness, including testing and 
  - May also review for more holistic issues, but not a requirement
- Expected to be responsive to review requests as per [community expectations]
- Assigned PRs to review related to subproject of expertise
- Assigned test bugs related to subproject of expertise
- Granted "read access" to specified project repos
- May get a badge on PR and issue comments

**Note:** Reviewers have no expectation of transitioning to an Approver role. The expectations for approver are quite high comparatively. If a reviwer drops below a reasonable threshold of activity (definable, project to project) for 2 months they will be sent a warning, notifying them that they have 1 month to re-assert their activity level or they will rotated to the role of "member". 

## Approver

Code approvers are able to both review and approve code contributions.  While
code review is focused on code quality and correctness, approval is focused on
holistic acceptance of a contribution including: backwards / forwards
compatibility, adhering to API and flag conventions, subtle performance and
correctness issues, interactions with other parts of the system, etc.

**Defined by:** *approvers* entry in a CODEOWNERS file in a repo owned by the
Chef Software Inc. project.

Approver status is scoped to a part of the codebase.

### Requirements

The following apply to the part of codebase for which one would be an approver
in an [OWNERS] file (for repos using the bot).

- Reviewer of the codebase for at least 3 months
- Primary reviewer for at least 10 substantial PRs to the codebase
- Reviewed or merged some large (relative to the project) number of substantial PRs to the codebase. A larger number than the requirement for a reviewer. In the case of a high activity project like Chef, or Habitat we suggest that number be around 30 PRs.
- Nominated by a subproject owner
  - With no objections from other subproject owners
  - Done through PR to update the top-level OWNERS file

### Responsibilities and privileges

The following apply to the part of codebase for which one would be an approver
in an [OWNERS] file (for repos using the bot).

- Approver status may be a precondition to accepting large code contributions
- Demonstrate sound technical judgement
- Responsible for project quality control via [code reviews]
  - Focus on holistic acceptance of contribution such as dependencies with other features, backwards / forwards
    compatibility, API and flag definitions, etc
- Expected to be responsive to review requests as per [community expectations]
- Mentor contributors and reviewers
- May approve code contributions for acceptance

## Subproject Owner

**Note:** This is a generalized high-level description of the role, and the
specifics of the subproject owner role's responsibilities and related
processes *MUST* be defined for individual teams or subprojects.

Subproject Owners are the technical authority for a subproject in Chef Software
Inc. projects.  They *MUST* have demonstrated both good judgement and responsibility
towards the health of that subproject.  Subproject Owners *MUST* set technical
direction and make or approve design decisions for their subproject - either
directly or through delegation of these responsibilities.

**Defined by:** *owners* entry in subproject [CODEOWNERS] files as defined by [teams.yaml]  *subproject.owners*

### Requirements

The process for becoming an subproject Owner should be defined in the team 
charter of the team owning the subproject.  Unlike the roles outlined above, the
Owners of a subproject are typically limited to a relatively small group of
decision makers and updated as fits the needs of the subproject.

The following apply to the subproject for which one would be an owner.

- Deep understanding of the technical goals and direction of the subproject
- Deep understanding of the technical domain of the subproject
- Sustained contributions to design and direction by doing all of:
  - Authoring and reviewing proposals
  - Initiating, contributing and resolving discussions (emails, GitHub issues, meetings)
  - Identifying subtle or complex issues in designs and implementation PRs
- Directly contributed to the subproject through implementation and / or review

### Responsibilities and privileges

The following apply to the subproject for which one would be an owner.

- Make and approve technical design decisions for the subproject.
- Set technical direction and priorities for the subproject.
- Define milestones and releases.
- Mentor and guide approvers, reviewers, and contributors to the subproject.
- Ensure continued health of subproject
  - Adequate test coverage to confidently release
  - Tests are passing reliably (i.e. not flaky) and are fixed when they fail
- Ensure a healthy process for discussion and decision making is in place.
- Work with other subproject owners to maintain the project's overall health and success holistically
