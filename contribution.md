# Signing Commits

All commits in a pull request must be signed by the author with a Developer Certificate of Origin "DCO".
* See this post for more details on the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://blog.chef.io/2016/09/19/introducing-developer-certificate-of-origin/) and how to sign commits with it.
* All projects must use the [DCO Bot](https://github.com/chef/dcob) to verify that commits are signed. (NOTE: This will soon be moved into an internal Chef repo).
