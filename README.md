# Chef Software Communities

Welcome to the Chef Software OSS communities!

This is a starting point for contributing to all of Chef's software and a wonderful
spot for information on how to join in on the fun.

To learn more about each of our project's structure and orgainzation, please refer to
[Project Governance](to be added later) information.

## Communicating

The [communication](communication/README.md) page lists communications channels like chat, GitHub issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

For more specific topics, check out an individual project.

## How We're Organized

Chef Software (the company) produces many products such as Chef, InSpec, and Habitat. Each of these products is fully open source and comprised of one or more open source projects. For instance the Chef product is comprised of chef, ohai, various mixlib projects, and more.

Many of our projects include sub-projects, which are repositories of code that are tightly coupled to another project. For example the inspec project has a sub-project of the audit cookbook as changes to the inspec coebase more than often require updates to the audit cookbook.

All governance of Chef projects must operate within the requirements set by the Chef OSS Practices committee, all of which are documented under [Governance](governance.md), however *Teams* can have their own policy for contribution, described in their `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in their project repo (e.g. habitat/CONTRIBUTING.md), communication standards, etc. so long as those policies meet the base Chef Software policy.

## Contribute

A first step towards contributing is to pick from the [list of Chef Software Projects](added later). Read the team's contribution policy, start attending team meetings, join the chat channel, subscribe to the mailing list. Teams will have a set of "Help Wanted" issues that can help new contributors get involved.

The [Contributor Guide] provides detailed instructions on how to get your code accepted into core including:

  1. Doing a thing!
  2. Doing some other thing!
  3. Perhaps doing a final thing!?

## Maintainership

We encourage all contributors to become maintainers. We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers, and code owners. Learn about requirements of maintainership in our [Community Membership](to be added later) page.
