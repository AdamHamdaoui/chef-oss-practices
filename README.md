# Chef Inc. Communities

Welcome to the Chef inc. OSS communities!

This is a starting point for contributing to all Chef Inc. software and a wonderful
spot for information on how to join in on the fun.

To learn more about each of our project's structure and orgainzation, please refer to
[Project Governance](to be added later) information.

## Communicating

The [communication](to be added later) page lists communications channels like chat, issues, mailing lists, conferences, etc.

For more specific topics, check out an individual project!

## Governance

Chef has [X] types of groups that are officially supported:

  - *Projects* are exactly what they sound like. Groups of individuals or teams working towards a common goal on a combined set of OSS software/repositories. Projects are typically persistent though the set of software contained in that project could change. Each Chef Inc. Engineer typically works within the bounds of a project though these bounds are flexible and there is frequently cross-pollination between projects.
  - *Teams* are sets of people within an individual project that focus on various parts of that project. Teams _must_ have open and transparent proceedings and communication. Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute to a team provided they follow the Chef OSS Code of Conduct and read to understand the group's governance policy.
  - *Guilds* are a cross-cutting group of individuals with shared interests on a specific subject that may be tangential to the project or vertical they are a member of. The intention of guilds is to provide cross-pollination and knowledge share on those subjects. These can be anything from a group sharing knowledge on a specific language - e.g. the Go guild, to a group discussing the merits of various web frameworks - e.g. the Web Guild and anything inbetween.
  - *Committees* are named sets of people that are chartered to take on sensitive or specific topics. This group is encouraged to be as open as possible while achieving its mission but, because of the potential nature of the topics discussed, private communications are allowed.

All governance of Chef Inc. Projects must operate within the requirements set by the Chef OSS Practices committee, all of which are documented here, however *Teams* can have their own policy for contribution, described in a `README` or `CONTRIBUTING` file in the Project folder in this repo (e.g. habitat/CONTRIBUTING.md), their own mailing list, chat channel, etc. so long as those policy's meet the Chef Inc. requirements. 

## Contribute

A first step towards contributing is to pick from the [list of Chef Inc. Projects](added later). Read the team's contribution policy, start attending team meetings, join the chat channel, subscribe to the mailing list. Teams will have a set of "Help Wanted" issues that can help new contributors get involved.

The [Contributor Guide] provides detailed instructions on how to get your code accepted into core including:

  1. Doing a thing!
  2. Doing some other thing!
  3. Perhaps doing a final thing!?

## Maintainership

We encourage all contributors to become maintainers. We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers, and code owners. Learn about requirements of maintainership in our [Community Membership](to be added later) page.
